# WORKFLOW — Stroke Pharmacology Literature Review (7 phases)

## Phase 1 — Define the review question & scope
**Goal:** lock topic boundaries so search/extraction doesn’t drift.

Checklist:
- Stroke type: ischemic / ICH / SAH
- Intervention: drug class / compound / target / pathway
- Evidence: preclinical / clinical / both
- Outcomes: core (functional + lesion) + safety
- Review type: narrative vs systematic vs meta

Deliverables:
- One-paragraph “review question”
- Inclusion/exclusion rules draft

---

## Phase 2 — Literature search plan (databases + registries)
**Goal:** reproducible search strategy.

Databases (pick at least 2):
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- Embase
- Web of Science / Scopus (optional)

Registries (if clinical involved):
- ClinicalTrials.gov (and/or WHO ICTRP if needed)

Deliverables:
- Search strings (MeSH + keywords) for each database
- Registry search keywords + captured trial IDs

---

## Phase 3 — Screening & study selection (PRISMA style if systematic)
**Goal:** transparent selection.

Steps:
1) Deduplicate in Zotero/EndNote
2) Title/abstract screen → full-text screen
3) Log exclusion reasons (systematic review)

Deliverables:
- Final included list
- Exclusion reasons summary

---

## Phase 4 — Data extraction (split preclinical vs clinical)
### 4A Preclinical (animal / in vitro)
Extract:
- Model: MCAO (transient/permanent), photothrombosis, collagenase-ICH, etc.
- Animal: species/strain/sex/age, comorbidities
- Design: randomization, blinding, sample size, temperature control
- Intervention: dose/route/frequency, time-to-treatment window
- Outcomes: infarct volume, neuro score (mNSS/Bederson), edema, BBB markers, cytokines, survival
- Safety: hemorrhagic transformation, mortality

### 4B Clinical
Extract:
- Trial phase/design, inclusion criteria
- Time window, co-therapies (tPA/EVT), endpoints (mRS/NIHSS), safety (sICH)
- Effect size, subgroup findings, limitations

Deliverables:
- Two extraction tables (preclinical + clinical)

---

## Phase 5 — Evidence synthesis (how to organize the story)
Recommended organization (choose one):
A) By therapeutic strategy: reperfusion-adjunct, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, BBB protection, antioxidant/mitochondria, anti-cell-death  
B) By target/pathway: e.g., NLRP3, TLR4/NF-κB, Nrf2/HO-1, microglia polarization, ferroptosis regulators  
C) By time window: hyperacute/acute/subacute/chronic repair

If meta-analysis:
- Define effect size, heterogeneity approach, sensitivity analyses
- Preclinical vs clinical must not be pooled together

Deliverables:
- Section map + “key points” per section
- (Optional) meta plan

---

## Phase 6 — Quality assurance (reporting + bias + translatability)
Preclinical focus:
- Reporting completeness (ARRIVE-style items)
- Risk of bias summary (randomization/blinding/allocation concealment)

Clinical focus:
- Trial reporting completeness (CONSORT-style items)
- Bias sources: selection, performance, attrition, selective reporting

Translational checklist:
- Time-to-treatment window matches realistic clinical window?
- Brain exposure/BBB penetration supported?
- Safety risks addressed?
- Endpoints clinically meaningful?

Deliverables:
- A short “quality & limitations” section draft + checklist table

---

## Phase 7 — Incremental updates (living review mindset)
- Maintain a “new papers” log monthly/quarterly
- Update tables first, then revise narrative
- Version notes: what changed and why

Deliverables:
- Update log template entry
